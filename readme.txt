Dear Prof.Zhou,

My name is He Feiyu and I am a student in EEE class 5, I have taken part in your Power Electronics course in spring of 2019 and finished with an A in the class. I was wondering you'd consider writing a letter of recommendation on my behalf. I would like to further my study in the field of Electronic Engineering in UK after graduating from UESTC, so it would be of great help if I could receive a letter of recommendation from you in support of the application. I would really appreciate it.

Best regards,

HeFeiyu
